# PyBer Analysis


## Overview of the Analysis
Per V. Isualize and Omar, the purpose of this analysis is to summarize how the PyBer ride-share data differs by city type (urban, rural, and suburban) and provides recommendations to addresss disparities among city types. 


## Results

### Summary Table
As shown in the summary table below, the results of the analysis reveal noteable differences in ride-share data according to city type: urban, suburban, and rural
PyBer ride-sharing is especially popular in urban cities, where the sum of total rides is more than double the sum suburban and rural rides together. As a result, the total fares are markerdly higher and the total number of drivers surprasses 2,000. The average fare per ride and average fare per driver have an inverse relationship; while the average fare per ride for rural cities is lower compared to the average fare per driver, the average fare per ride for urban cities is higher than the average fare per driver. Overall, ride-sharing in rural cities is more expensive for the user than in suburban and urban areas.
