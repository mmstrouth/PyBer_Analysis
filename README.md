# PyBer Analysis


## Overview of the Analysis
Per V. Isualize and Omar, the purpose of this analysis is to summarize how the PyBer ride-share data differs by city type (urban, rural, and suburban) and provides recommendations to addresss disparities among city types. 


## Results

### Summary Table
As shown in the summary table below, the results of the analysis reveal noteable differences in ride-share data according to city type: urban, suburban, and rural
PyBer ride-sharing is especially popular in urban cities, where the sum of total rides is more than double the sum suburban and rural rides together. As a result, the total fares are markerdly higher and the total number of drivers surprasses 2,000. The average fare per ride and average fare per driver have an inverse relationship; while the average fare per ride for rural cities is lower compared to the average fare per driver, the average fare per ride for urban cities is higher than the average fare per driver. Overall, ride-sharing in rural cities is more expensive for the user than in suburban and urban areas. Interestingly, we can also see that there is a rate of 0.676 rides per driver in urban cities, while suburban cities see a rate of 1.276 riders per driver and 1.603 rides per driver in rural cities. This data, coupled with the average fare per ride, could indicate that urban rides, while more popular, may be shorter.

### Line Graph
The line graph titled "Total Fare by City Type" reveals another dimension of PyBer's ride-sharing data, aggregated by different weeks of the year and city type. Overall it reflects the same message as the summary table: ride-sharing is appreciably more popular in urban cities. This graph also provides insight into the differences in usage, depending on the time of the year, as well as the city type. One can note that within the provided timeframe, April was a relatively popular month in rural cities while there was peak total fares beginning of March for suburban cities. Urban cities consistently outperform the other types of cities, while oscillating between total fares of approximately $1,600 to $2,500.

## Summary
As a result of these analyses, I recommend three possibly divergent paths:
- Increase ride-sharing in rural cities via the following:
  - Collect data on the circumstances of ride-sharing rural areas to better cater to their needs
  - Increase advertising in rural cities, especially during spring months, to increase ridership
- Eliminate ride-sharing in rural areas completely
- Increase fares in rural areas
